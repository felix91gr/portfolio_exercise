#
# Also, the Portfolio class has
# - A collection of “allocated” Stocks that

#     the Portfolio is aiming (i.e. 40% META, 60% APPL)

# Add documentation/comments to understand your thinking process and solution


## Notes for me, on formatting:
## https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names
## Fn names should be lowercase, words separated by underscores.
## Variable names should follow the same convention
