# Portfolio Exercise

To avoid other applicants finding this repo, I'm not describing it much further than to say: this is my solution to the exercise proposed [here](https://jobs.lever.co/fintual/190f1cb2-7bb3-4d16-b584-032d8125a75c).

Regardless, now that you're here: **Welcome!** Everything, including my thinking process and solution, should be inside of `Portfolio_Exercise.py`.

I hope we get to chat soon ^.^
